  digital-media-based artifacts, such as software source code and
  Web documents, can provide significant practical benefits.
  Fortunately, these artifacts often have records of their change
  and access history stored in, for example, version control
  databases and Web server access logs.  We describe an approach to
  integrate such atomic traces of authorship and usage to produce
  quantitative estimates of author expertise, the types and sizes of
  user populations, and the quality and veracity of the artifacts
  themselves.  We have incorporated this approach into the Expertise
  Browser, a Web-based tool that displays the relationships among
  authors, users, and artifacts based on the accumulation of
  authorship and usage traces. It can be used to find domain experts
  on a relevant set of artifacts, to compile expertise of an
  individual or organization into a digital resume, and to assess
  the artifacts based on author expertise and types of user
  populations.},
